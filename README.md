# Project 2

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

## Key Files ##


* chat.js - manages incoming and outgoing messages
* init.js - loads saved application state (current schannel) upon http page load
* misc.js - placeholder for functions
* mustache.js - third party library template library https://mustache.github.io


## Additional Functionality ##

The ability to delete messages was implemented - a link is displayed for
every eligible message. Also, message notifications were added, during
implementation and testing it became apparent there was a need for new
message notifications.
